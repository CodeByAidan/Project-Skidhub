Introducing **_Project-Skidhub_**! The simple user-friendly python script/application that does the hard Git operations through ease!

It downloads specific files, specific file extensions, specific repos, etc. It also has search abilities to find those specific files that you have been looking for. No need to search for that needle in the haystack anymore! :smile:

## How to install

1. Install requirements:

  If you have pip installed go into the folder where all of the source code is located and run a command-prompt/terminal and run the following code:
  
  ```python
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

 _If you do not have pip installed go into the folder, and run a terminal/command-prompt with the following lines of code:_
  
  ```python
  curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
  python get-pip.py
  ```

1. Run the python script:
  
  Type in your terminal/command-prompt:

  ```python
  python skidgithub.py
  ```

1. Get a GitHub token:
  (If you do not want to use a token, you can skip this step)
  (Skip this step if you downloaded v2.1 or higher, and the auto-token feature was used to get a token for you.)

- Go to [GitHub then Settings then Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- Click on "Generate new token" then click "Generate new token (classic)"
- Give it a name (I recommend "Project Skidhub")
- Make sure to check the box that says "repo"
- Click on "Generate token"
- Copy the token
- Paste the token into the application on the first start-up (or go to /settings/config.yml and paste it into the "authorization_token" section. No quotes needed)
- Click "Save"
- Restart the application

This in short means that Github prohibits any form of bots and automation, which means that skidding is prohibited by ToS, and lawfully. This is for educational purposes only, if you want to use it use it at your own risk. We do not take any responsibility for you.
