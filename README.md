  ```console
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  *If you do not have pip installed go into the folder, and run a terminal/command-prompt with the following lines of code:*
  
  ```console
  curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py

  ```
2. Run the python script:
  Type in your terminal/command-prompt:

3. Follow the instructions on the menu page on the terminal/command-prompt from there! :)
